# CA2-OODP

Patterns used on that program:

General Design Patterns its a description or templante for how solve the problem that ca be used in many diffirent situations.
This designs patterns can speed up the development by providing tested;

1- Decorator Pattern = add responsability to the objects dynamically. In this project we will use this pattern to create 100 
companies and investor dynamically.

2- Strategy Patterns = encapsulates an algorithms inside a class. We will use the algorithms to complete this codes, so its will 
be contains the logics and strategies to sell Shares of companies and invest, and simulator of all this.

3- Private Class Data =  reducing exposure of attributes by limiting their visibility and  number of class attributes by 
encapsulating them in single Data object, we've beem used that concept while will will have be accessing the Private members 
of class using Accessors.
